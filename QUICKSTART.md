# Quick Start Guide - Google Test Automation Suite

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive test automation framework for testing Google's web services with:

- **UI Tests**: Playwright + SpecFlow + NUnit for browser automation
- **API Tests**: RestSharp + NUnit for HTTP API testing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

## ✅ What's Already Working

✅ **Project Structure Created**
- Solution file with two test projects
- Proper NuGet package references
- SpecFlow configuration

✅ **API Tests (7 tests) - PASSING**
- Google homepage accessibility
- Response validation
- Performance testing
- Security headers validation
- Multiple endpoint testing

✅ **UI Test Framework Ready**
- SpecFlow feature files with BDD scenarios
- Page Object Model implementation
- Playwright hooks for browser management
- Step definitions for Google search testing

✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Configured**
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated test execution
- Test reporting and artifacts
- Scheduled daily runs

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start Commands

### 1. Setup (One-time)
```powershell
# Run the setup script
.\setup.ps1 -Action setup
```

### 2. Run Tests
```powershell
# Run all tests
.\setup.ps1 -Action test

# Run only API tests (working now)
.\setup.ps1 -Action api

# Run only UI tests (requires Playwright browsers)
.\setup.ps1 -Action ui

# Run UI tests with visible browser
.\setup.ps1 -Action ui -Headless:$false
```

### 3. Manual Commands
```powershell
# Build solution
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run API tests only
dotnet test GoogleAPITests/GoogleAPITests.csproj

# Run UI tests only (after Playwright setup)
dotnet test GoogleUITests/GoogleUITests.csproj
```

## 📋 Test Scenarios Included

### API Tests (RestSharp)
1. **Homepage Accessibility** - Verifies Google homepage returns 200
2. **Content Validation** - Checks response contains expected elements
3. **Performance Testing** - Ensures response time under 5 seconds
4. **Security Headers** - Validates security-related HTTP headers
5. **Multiple Endpoints** - Tests various Google service endpoints

### UI Tests (Playwright + SpecFlow)
1. **Homepage Loading** - Verifies Google logo, search box, and button
2. **Search Functionality** - Tests search with different terms
3. **Results Validation** - Confirms search results appear
4. **Title Updates** - Verifies page title changes after search

## 🔧 Next Steps for UI Tests

To run UI tests, you need to install Playwright browsers:

```powershell
# Install Playwright CLI globally
dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI

# Install browsers
playwright install chromium

# Then run UI tests
dotnet test GoogleUITests/GoogleUITests.csproj
```
